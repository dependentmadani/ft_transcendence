1. Stop docker app from running, and make sure to use the following wizzard command `42 -docker`, just to make sure that all docker configuration are located at goinfre for any space issues.

2. Create `data` folder in `/tmp`, then all the required folders to store volumes data on each of those folders. Meaning that for backend container should have: `/tmp/data/backend`.

3. Run `make` command, have fun and let the hunger games begins ðŸ˜Œ.
